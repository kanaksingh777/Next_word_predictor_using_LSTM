# Next Word Predictor using LSTM

This project is a simple next-word prediction model built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It learns from the **Reuters news dataset** and is capable of predicting the next most likely word(s) based on a given input phrase. It’s a basic demonstration of how language modeling works using PyTorch and NLTK.

---

## Project Overview

The model is trained on thousands of sentences from the Reuters corpus. It learns the sequence of words and builds up a statistical understanding of what word is likely to come next. This can be useful in applications like autocomplete, chatbots, or even more advanced language generation tasks.

You give it a sentence like:
```
"Last year South Korea"
```

And it predicts:
```
→ had → a → three → in → an → arbitration ...
```

## What’s Inside

- Tokenization using NLTK
- Vocabulary building from scratch
- Sequence padding
- Custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader
- LSTM-based neural network for training
- Next word prediction logic with inference

---

## How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   The Reuters dataset is loaded and tokenized into sentences and words. A vocabulary is built from all unique words. Each word is converted into a numerical index.

2. **Sequence Creation**  
   The model is trained on word sequences. For every sentence, training sequences are generated where each sequence predicts the next word from its context.

3. **Padding**  
   Since sequences vary in length, they are padded with zeros on the left to standardize input size.

4. **Model Architecture**  
   The model consists of an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a fully connected output layer that predicts the next word.

5. **Training**  
   The model is trained for 100 epochs using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. Loss decreases significantly as training progresses.

6. **Prediction**  
   Given an input sentence, the model predicts the most probable next word, one at a time.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- NumPy

You can install the libraries with:
```bash
pip install torch numpy nltk
```

### Download NLTK Corpora

In your Python script or notebook:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('reuters')
```

---

## Example Usage

```python
input_text = "Last year South Korea"
output = prediction(model, vocab, input_text)
print(output)
```

The model will predict the next word and return the sentence with the predicted word appended.

You can repeat this in a loop to generate a full sequence of words.

## Training Sample

Here’s how the loss drops over time:

```
Epoch 1: Loss = 3253.29
Epoch 10: Loss = 867.63
Epoch 50: Loss = 43.50
Epoch 100: Loss = 39.92
```

## Possible Improvements

- Add beam search for smarter predictions
- Use a larger or custom dataset
- Deploy the model via a simple web app (e.g., Streamlit)
- Incorporate attention mechanisms or transformers
- a better GPU
